//All changes of version info, heading, calibration state and error is notified
//to the upper layers with a MSG_COMPASS_REFRESH message.

//See also the COMPASS_INVALIDATE_ON_ERROR switch above.
//
//note 1: Not valid until about 2 seconds after reset/init (check .bValid).
//note 2: The error count simply increases on every error. Intended to be implemen-
//        ted as turning wheel "-\|/".
//note 4: If this is called multiple times in a short sequence (or, what is very
//        unlikely, interferes with another command sent to the compass), the compass
//        just does'nt react. So these functions may be called simply as a reaction
//        on the key pressed by the user, disregarding all timing. The user has to
//        observe compass reaction.
